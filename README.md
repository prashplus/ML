All the sample Machine Learning codes required during the learning phase

## Getting Started

The instructions will be in the Readme of each directory or it will be in the resepected Python file in form of comments.

### Prerequisites

Look out for the prerequisites dependencies in the import section or will be mentioned in the requirements.txt



### Setup

Setup your Tensorflow or Tensorflow-GPU as the way you want.
Follow the instructions on the official site of tensorflow at: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

For the easiest way install Anaconda and follow the steps

```
C:> conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.5
```
Activate your environment

```
C:> activate tensorflow
 (tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change 
```
Install Tensorflow using PIP

```
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow 
```
or 
```
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```


## Running the tests

Invoke the python
```
$ python
```
Run the following lines in python

```
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> print(sess.run(hello))
```
